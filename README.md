The user can do the following:
<br/>-Join the group chat and send a message to everyone
<br/>-Retrieve a list of all connected users from the server by typing /list
<br/>-Send a Private Message to someone by typing @Username "message"
<br/>-Kick someone from the group chat by typing /kick "username"
